                               Hey Vidhi…



(These is going to be little bit long..

So read it when you are free..)

You told me that you can not accept my gifts rn… So i created these for you..

I don’t know you gonna like it or not pn aa return karvu possible nathi…


You know you came in my life when there are lots of things going on.. and yeah i’m

Going through a lot that time I didn’t want to talk anyone , I was numb…but whenever you were stop by and came to met me and whatever time you there i was feeling so good every time when i see you..I shared those things with you that i never share with anyone. ..i never take you for granted even once…i scared of losing you all the time k opened up thaish and you will leave because of that but yet i did…Idk how but i told you that i’m a guy who keeps who never share anything with anyone but i did that. I never cried infront of anyone but i cried infront of you..You said you didn’t reciprocate and ik sometimes you felt that your efforts didn’t appreciated. But trust me I appreciated each and every effort of yours and I remember that too. I appreciated you more than you will ever know.. I really don’t want that you felt that way..maybe I didn’t express what i feel for you cuz I didn’t want that negative energy affect s you.. i want to come with you purely.. and i did..

you know i told you i’m trynaa learn you… and i did at some point.. 

But when i say i want learn you that meant 

I want to know each and every thing about you.. how’s childhood, what type a bag you used in your school, how’s your school, when you drive cycle for the first time, when you get so much hurt first time, how’s vidhi when see was 7 years old,what makes her so happy each and everything.

I get to know about so many things of yours too.. and whom you like the most in your family…eto badhu yaad 6e mane aama bau long thayi jashe ..

 I will talk about only us..

So i remember that when i picked you up for the first time you told me use HOLD button at traffic light.. i really didn’t knew 😅… i used to say IGHT instead of Alright..

Ik your “ you are such a clown” ..

Ik you didn’t intentionally try to be mean.. but automatically thai jaai 6e.. ik you can not hold you laugh in serious situations..ik you didn’t like grey hairs😂.. ik meaning of your K, breathe vidhi, your style of waving hand, your compliments…,ik when you say JE NE KARVU HOI AE KARE J, irritated thayi ne when i said that i can’t able to meet,
Ik when we watched horror movies together and my awkward moment and still we didn’t complete 365 days movie  yet tho..😅
Ik you were pissed of when you want to hold my hand and i said “ LEH Leh”..
I remembered when i piggyback you for the first time and you said these wasn’t a proper way to carry me..
I remembered when we together you didn’t  touched your phone … you didn’t even picked up your dad call..
Then hu 10min madva avu to upset thayi javanu ane kehvanu aana karta to naa avyo hoi to saru..

Your mints, aunty ni vaghareli cereal, panda cookies , bueno, fries, lots of things you brought it for me at dunkin.. specially a Chipotle bowl ae b walk kari ne… I can’t forget that ofc…

I can’t forget that you cried and overthink because of me.. and maybe because of my actions too..but trust me I didn’t want to hurt you at all and never want that too..I'm sorry vidhi


Ik what is quality time for you, that person needs to be infront of your eyes.. your love language is physical touch, I remember when i was injured at garba and you were so pissed at that guy so much,

 you becoming a doctor when anything happens to me.. like take a probiotic I started because of you, eating prunes, drink water, trying to find causing of burping, try to find cause of nose bleeding..ik how you used to care me a lot,

When i said job made to i will move and you was like amari jode to naa j rehvu hoi ne.. NJ ma..

Then you ummhhhmm style, your smile I remembered… I didn’t seen that for while and I’m missing that but that’s a different case.. 

I remember when you said you used to go out at 3:00 to meet only and you were telling me you couldn’t even do at 10..

I want to tell you that i also have same care for you.. i know sometimes what makes you sad, when you talk about your Nani, when you talk about your past, when you talk about your Baa, when you talk about that guy who scares you a lot in india and

Also what makes you happy too… traveling,long rides, exploring new things, mountains, solo trips, nature, animals, stargazing, moon, Bubble tea 😅, your bubby milo, RDX(I don’t know do i ever get a chance to drive in these life 😅),karate at some points, flexing your figure 😂,

Self compliments( but hu aapu 6u compliments ne) ,J&J’s merchandise, your soft toys,

Myself also makes you happy but maybe not anymore😅 I’m kidding…

But yet I didn’t know what you were overthink every night… ae aaj sudhi nai kahyu te…

Tane yaad 6e i told you give me some time  i will change my self..and i did yk that right..i never done that action again that hurts you not even mistakenly.. ek vaar te kahyu aa nai gamtu i never done that again no.. 

Maybe after reading all these there are two possibilities that you can think..

1)you will think that i’m such a creep and so needy… why he is doing all these…and push me away…and it’s fine it’s totally your choice.. i will never bother you 

2)you will loved these and you will actually understand everything and every feelings of mine.. and keep me with you..



Whatever you choose to think..I respect your decision.. choose what makes you happy and best for you.. you don’t need to think about other person all the time..

Ik you are like that when you are serious you don’t want to hurt others even tho that thing will hurt you…don’t worry about me at all…

Idk you will even think like that or not…but i want to tell that yeah you are important to me and I don’t n’t want to lose you at all..

And sorry for the last lines..ik tu ae read kari ne angry thaish.. so ‘Breathhh Vidhi’.

These are my smaller steps… i want to do so many things with you , for you.

what tomorrow Holds

   But I promise

To live  every tomorrow 

    Inspired 

To see our stories

    Unfold 

To one another…


You are head to Toe  Breathtaking 

You are  blood to skin groundbreaking,

Because you are Vidhi..😅
